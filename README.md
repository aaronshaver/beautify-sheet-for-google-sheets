# RepairFormat for Google Sheets 1.0

This script strips special formatting from a Google Sheet, and then applies new formatting (per a preferences object) to the sheet.

Why use it?

I use Google Sheets to track my checking account. Every couple weeks, I perform edits on the sheet and part of this includes pasting in confirmation numbers and other data from billing websites. Most of this data is not plaintext -- it comes with bold, color, different font sizes, etc. My sheet looks like a mess after pasting in these pieces of text a bunch of times. So, now, in order to get a consistent look back to my spreadsheet, I can simply click the RepairFormat > Run menu item and have it scrub out those special formatting changes automatically.
